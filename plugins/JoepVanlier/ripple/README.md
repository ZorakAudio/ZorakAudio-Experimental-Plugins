# Ripple (Saike)

An unfinished scale/chord-oriented MIDI pattern sequencer with a graphical note grid.

## Quick start

1. Place it before a synth and route its MIDI output to that synth.
2. Draw a small pattern in the grid and choose a pattern and scale in the canvas.
3. Start the host transport to test note generation.

## Controls and routing

The source explicitly says work in progress / not ready for use. It has no declared sliders; interaction and pattern storage are handled by the canvas and serialized data. An empty default pattern does not benchmark active sequencing.

There are no declared slider parameters in this source. Use the graphical interface for its state and patterns.

## Native build and help

This JSFX is packaged as a native VST3/CLAP using the LLVM compiler and shared JUCE runtime. Its custom canvas uses the native Legacy GFX path when present. Hidden slider identities remain available for state/automation. Audio and MIDI pin configuration is inferred at build time; connect the pins in your DAW. Imports and packaged images are included in the build.

The `?` button displays this README embedded at build time; no online manual or loose README is needed. A documentation update takes effect after rebuilding and replacing the plugin.

## Performance comparison

Measured 2026-10-09 on AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS (Windows x64), at 48 kHz with default controls. 5 serial trials per buffer, 4 seconds of generated audio after one second of warmup, alternating engine order. The reference is the vendored **native x64 SSE WDL/EEL2 JIT**, not its portable interpreter. LLVM uses the production optimized final backend.

These are **DSP-only** timings: audio sections and their required sample/buffer marshalling. Compilation, initialization, signal generation, control/MIDI/transport setup, output checks, GFX and the full JUCE/DAW callback are excluded. They do not predict total REAPER CPU or an installed plugin's complete callback time. No algorithm simplification was made.

**Observed output: identical finite float audio values and matching MIDI for this workload in every trial.** The comparison does not distinguish positive and negative zero. This covers the measured defaults, not every preset or interactive graphics state.

| Buffer | WDL µs/frame | LLVM µs/frame | WDL time / LLVM time | Trial ratio range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 64 | 0.0984 | 0.0639 | 1.53× | 1.51–1.58× |
| 512 | 0.0387 | 0.0108 | 3.54× | 3.43–3.86× |

A frame includes all processed channels. Ratios are median paired WDL/LLVM times: above 1 favours LLVM; below 1 favours WDL. Ratios near 1 should be read as similar speed, considering the trial range.

**Workload limit:** The default pattern is empty; this does not establish active MIDI-sequencing performance.
